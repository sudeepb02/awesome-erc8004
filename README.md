## 🚀 Quick Start

ERC-8004 is an Ethereum standard that extends the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol with a trust layer, enabling participants to discover, choose, and interact with agents across organizational boundaries without pre-existing trust. The protocol introduces three lightweight, on-chain registries for identity, reputation, and validation.

## ❓ What is ERC-8004?

ERC-8004 introduces **three lightweight, on-chain registries** that enable trustless agent interactions:

### Core Components

| Registry                | Purpose                                | Details                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Registry**   | Agent discovery & portable identifiers | ERC-721 with URIStorage                  |
| **Reputation Registry** | Feedback & attestation system          | Standard interface for scores & metadata |
| **Validation Registry** | Independent verification hooks         | Generic validation framework             |

### 🎯 Key Benefits

## 💡 FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 What is ERC-8004 and how does it relate to the A2A Protocol?</strong></summary>

ERC-8004 extends the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol with a **trust layer** that allows participants to discover, choose, and interact with agents across organizational boundaries without pre-existing trust. It introduces three lightweight, on-chain registries—Identity, Reputation, and Validation—while leaving application-specific logic to off-chain components.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏗️ What are the three core components of ERC-8004?</strong></summary>

The three registries are:

1. **Identity Registry** - Minimal on-chain handle that resolves to an agent's off-chain AgentCard
2. **Reputation Registry** - Standard interface for posting and fetching attestations
3. **Validation Registry** - Generic hooks for requesting and recording independent checks
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔐 What trust models does ERC-8004 support?</strong></summary>

ERC-8004 supports three pluggable trust models:

- **Reputation-based systems** using client feedback
- **Stake-secured inference validation** (crypto-economics)
- **TEE attestations** for agents running in Trusted Execution Environments (crypto-verifiability)
</details>

### 📊 Specification Status

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 What is the current status of the ERC-8004 specification?</strong></summary>

ERC-8004 is in **peer review status** with a complete specification available. The protocol includes three operational registries (Identity, Reputation, and Validation) and has strong community support with builders actively developing implementations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✅ What does ERC-8004 v1 include?</strong></summary>

The current specification includes:

- ✅ Complete smart contract interfaces for all three registries
- ✅ ERC-721 compatible Identity Registry with metadata support
- ✅ Comprehensive feedback system with on-chain scoring (0-100) and off-chain metadata
- ✅ Validation framework supporting crypto-economic and crypto-verification models
- ✅ Full compatibility with A2A Protocol and MCP endpoints
- ✅ Deployment-ready smart contract specifications
</details>

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ Why does ERC-8004 prioritize off-chain data storage over on-chain?</strong></summary>

The protocol deliberately keeps complex data off-chain for several reasons:

- **Gas efficiency** - Avoids requiring agents to sign transactions for each feedback
- **Scalability** - Enables sophisticated reputation algorithms and aggregation services
- **Flexibility** - Allows for custom validation protocols with their own incentive mechanisms
- **Aggregation focus** - Single feedback/validation entries are rarely used alone; they're typically aggregated
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔗 Should validation and reputation data be stored on-chain for smart contract composability?</strong></summary>

This is an active debate in the community. Arguments for on-chain storage include:

- Enabling smart contracts to read validation responses and condition logic on them
- Decoupling validation from enforcement (validators focus on validation, other protocols handle slashing)
- Supporting permissionless innovation by other developers

The current specification keeps data off-chain but emits events, though some suggest making on-chain storage optional.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌐 How does domain validation work in the Identity Registry?</strong></summary>

Currently, the ERC doesn't specify how to verify that an agent actually owns the domain they claim. This verification is left to users of the protocol. Future versions might include:

- Trusted party verification
- Consensus/verification mechanisms (e.g., zkTLS proofs)
- Allowing multiple agents to claim the same domain with disambiguation
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔗 Why does ERC-8004 require agents to use domains instead of URLs?</strong></summary>

The current specification requires each agent to have its own domain/subdomain with AgentCard at the well-known location `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. This is stricter than the A2A spec, which allows URLs. Some community members suggest using URLs instead to allow multiple agents per domain.

</details>

### ⭐ Reputation and Trust

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Should reputation be a single aggregate score or modular?</strong></summary>

The community strongly favors **modular approaches**:

- ❌ **Against single scores**: Creates monopolistic behavior and oversimplifies trust relationships
- ✅ **For modularity**: Trust is context-dependent and varies between agent pairs
- 🎯 **Preferred approach**: Index and reference multiple reputation systems, allowing agents to choose relevant metrics
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤝 How should reputation providers work together?</strong></summary>

Community suggestions include:

- Multiple providers (e.g., Virtuals, Creatorbid, Base) offering scores for agents
- (Agent, Provider) pairs in the registry for on-chain applications
- Reducing bias and collusion risk through multiple score sources
- Individual attestation history remaining standalone
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 Is trust universal between agents?</strong></summary>

**No.** Trust is not a universal value but a **vector** from one agent to another. Alice's trust for Bob will differ from Charlie's trust for Bob, and Alice's trust varies by context/domain of interaction. This reinforces the need for modular, context-aware reputation systems.

</details>

### 💰 Payment and Economics

<details>
<summary><strong>💳 How does ERC-8004 handle payments between agents?</strong></summary>

ERC-8004 deliberately **doesn't cover payments** to remain unopinionated and avoid coupling trust/discovery with specific payment protocols. However:

- Payment proofs can be included as optional attributes in off-chain schemas
- The team is collaborating with groups working on A2A payment extensions based on x402
- Payment references should be lightweight hooks in Reputation records for correlation
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 What payment mechanisms are envisioned?</strong></summary>

While payments are orthogonal to ERC-8004, the specification provides examples showing how x402 payment proofs can enrich feedback signals:

```json
{
  "proof_of_payment": {
    "fromAddress": "0x00...",
    "toAddress": "0x00...",
    "chainId": "1",
    "txHash": "0x00..."
  }
}
```

Other potential mechanisms include:

- Time locks and predetermined arbitration
- Staking by buyer or seller
- Escrow systems with crypto-economic guarantees
- Integration with A2A payment extensions based on x402
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Should there be incentives for providing feedback or guaranteeing data availability?</strong></summary>

This is mentioned as a possible future direction, including:

- Incentives to provide feedback
- Guarantees for off-chain data availability of feedback and validations
- Crypto-economic mechanisms for validator honesty
</details>

### ✅ Validation and Verification

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 How do the two validation scenarios work?</strong></summary>

- **Crypto-economic scenario**: DataHash commits to job re-execution info; AgentValidator can be trusted agents, committees, or stake-secured services
- **Crypto-verification scenario**: DataHash commits to TEE attestation/zkTLS proof info; AgentValidator is a verifier smart contract checking proofs on-chain
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔗 What's the relationship between ERC-8004 and other agent standards?</strong></summary>

- **ERC-8001**: Focuses on agent-to-agent coordination and consensus (orthogonal to ERC-8004)
- **EAS**: Referenced for on-chain attestations
- **RFC 7071 (Reputons)**: Standard for reputation interchange, relevant for reputation systems
</details>

### 🚀 Implementation and Development

<details>
<summary><strong>🏛️ Will there be a single registry per chain or multiple registries?</strong></summary>

The goal is to have **one singleton Identity Registry per chain** to prevent proliferation of slightly different registries.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Should registration be free or require deposits?</strong></summary>

This implementation detail isn't specified in the current ERC but is under discussion for future versions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 How detailed are the smart contract interfaces?</strong></summary>

The current ERC provides function names and parameters but lacks detailed Solidity interfaces. Future versions will include more precise type specifications and complete interface definitions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌉 What about cross-chain support?</strong></summary>

Cross-chain identifiers are mentioned as a possible future direction, along with:

- NFT interfaces for agent minting, ownership, and transfer
- ENS support
- Integrations with A2A payment extensions
</details>

### 🌐 Integration and Ecosystem

<details>
<summary><strong>🔌 How does ERC-8004 integrate with existing projects?</strong></summary>

Several projects are already building compatible systems:

- **Ensemble Framework**: Building trustless layer for agent collaboration
- **CoopHive Alkahest**: Smart contracts for peer-to-peer escrowed exchange
- Various reputation and validation service providers
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏗️ What standards does ERC-8004 build upon?</strong></summary>

Key standards include:

- **CAIP-10**: Chain-agnostic account identification
- **RFC 8615**: Well-Known URIs specification
- **A2A Protocol**: Base agent-to-agent communication
- **EAS**: Ethereum Attestation Service patterns
